			Have you ever struggled cutting a Mango?
		</br>
			I have a solution for you!! 2 in fact!
		</br>
			Cut the Mango in half, then cut squares
		</br>
			into it with the skin still on.
		</br>
			This next one is much easier to do and is my favorite,
		</br>
			cut the Mango in half again, then get a glass cup.
		</br>
			(Glass cups work the best) Get 1 Mango slice
		</br>
			and slide it down the cup with the skin
		</br>
			on the outside of the cup and the good part inside.
		</br>
			Then, have a yummy Mango!!!
